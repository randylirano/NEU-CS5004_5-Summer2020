a) 2 % 3 = 2
>> The remainder operator return the remainder of integer division. In this case, 2.

b) 0 % 3 = 0
>> The remainder operator return the remainder of integer division. In this case, 0.

c) 3 % 3 = 0
>> The remainder operator return the remainder of integer division. In this case, 0. 
>> Because 3 is divisible by 3.

d) -2 % 3 = -2
>> The unary operator takes place before the modulo, so the modulo sees (-2) % 3
>> which return -2.

e) 2 % -3 = 2
>> The unary operator takes place before the modulo, so the modulo sees 2 % (-3)
>> which return 2.

f) -2 % -3 = -2
>> The unary operator takes place before the modulo, so the modulo sees (-2) % (-3)
>> which return -2.
